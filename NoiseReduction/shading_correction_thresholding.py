'''
In the above code, the shading_correction_thresholding function takes an image, block size, constant, kernel size, and threshold as input. 
The block size and constant are used for adaptive thresholding, the kernel size is used for median filtering, and the threshold is used to identify impulse noise.

The function first converts the input image to grayscale using cv2.cvtColor. Then, it applies adaptive thresholding using cv2.adaptiveThreshold 
with the cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C method, similar to the previous example.

Next, it applies median filtering using cv2.medianBlur to further reduce noise. 
Then, morphological opening is performed using cv2.morphologyEx with a rectangular kernel to suppress impulse noise.

Afterward, it calculates the absolute difference between the median filtered image and the morphologically opened image to identify the pixels affected by impulse noise. 
A binary mask is created using a threshold.

Finally, the noisy pixels are replaced with the corresponding median filtered values using the np.where function.

You can adjust the block size, constant, kernel size, and threshold based on the characteristics of your specific images to achieve the desired level of shading correction, 
thresholding, and impulse noise suppression.
